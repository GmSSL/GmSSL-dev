<<<<<<< HEAD
SSL_new, SSL_up_ref - create a new SSL structure for a connection

SSL_new - create a new SSL structure for a connection
>>>>>>> origin/master

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 SSL *SSL_new(SSL_CTX *ctx);
<<<<<<< HEAD
 int SSL_up_ref(SSL *s);
=======
>>>>>>> origin/master

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_new() creates a new B<SSL> structure which is needed to hold the
data for a TLS/SSL connection. The new structure inherits the settings
<<<<<<< HEAD
of the underlying context B<ctx>: connection method,
options, verification settings, timeout settings. An B<SSL> structure is
reference counted. Creating an B<SSL> structure for the first time increments
the reference count. Freeing it (using SSL_free) decrements it. When the
reference count drops to zero, any memory or resources allocated to the B<SSL>
structure are freed. SSL_up_ref() increments the reference count for an
existing B<SSL> structure.
=======
of the underlying context B<ctx>: connection method (SSLv2/v3/TLSv1),
options, verification settings, timeout settings.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item NULL

The creation of a new SSL structure failed. Check the error stack to
find out the reason.

=item Pointer to an SSL structure

The return value points to an allocated SSL structure.

<<<<<<< HEAD
SSL_up_ref() returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.
